📂 PROJECT SUMMARY: IWE (Improving the World Everywhere)

📍 ROOT LOCATION:
- Primary: C:\Users\james\Desktop\IWE\IWE.py
- Secondary: G:\Other computers\My laptop (1)\Documents\IWE\IWE.py
- Cloud Mirrors: OneDrive, Google Drive (links provided)

🧭 AGENT PURPOSE:
IWE is a universal, self-evolving Python agent designed to install itself on any device and improve its functionality—never degrade it. It enforces strict folder hygiene, provides visible feedback, and logs every operation with forensic clarity. It does not require VPN and operates autonomously under a single-root philosophy.

🛠️ CORE FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- ✅ *Folder Hygiene Enforcement*  
  - Halts execution if unexpected files exist at root  
  - Logs violations and shows popup alerts

- ✅ *Logging System (UTF-8 + Fallback)*  
  - Writes diagnostic logs in `logs/` folder using explicit UTF-8 encoding  
  - Auto-sanitizes non-ASCII characters if encoding fails  
  - All logs include timestamped filenames

- ✅ *Visible Feedback Enforcement*  
  - Uses Tkinter messageboxes for popups confirming execution, errors, and module detection  
  - Prevents silent background operation

- ✅ *Self-Development Logic*  
  - Automatically writes improvement proposals with structured JSON  
  - Includes system profile, reasoning, and actionable next steps

- ✅ *System Fingerprinting*  
  - Captures OS, architecture, CPU, RAM, disk usage, IP, and hostname  
  - Logs results with timestamp and triggers module scan logic

- ✅ *Enhancement Discovery Stub*  
  - Scans `modules/` folder for `.py` agents  
  - Detects and logs ready modules for feedback activation  
  - Alerts via popup if no match found

🪪 COMPATIBILITY:
- Built for Python 3.11+
- Uses `psutil`, `platform`, `socket`, `json`, `tkinter`
- Runs on Windows 64-bit platforms (MSC v.1938 64-bit AMD64 confirmed)

🚫 REMOVED FEATURES:
- VPN enforcement logic has been stripped per user instruction
- Emoji logging sanitized to avoid UnicodeEncodeError in environments using cp1252

🧠 NEXT PROMPTED ACTION:
Generate a sample enhancement module under `modules/`, e.g.:
- 🧹 RAM cleanup
- 📊 Disk usage analysis
- 🌐 Network adapter optimization  
Modules should self-log, confirm execution visibly, and return feedback to core agent.

This summary will be remembered for future expansions and agent iterations. Ready to build your first enhancement module whenever you give the signal.
